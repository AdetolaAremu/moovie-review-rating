# This is a movie rating application.Technologies used Node.js, Express, MongoDB and AWS S3.

# The design pattern for this MVC, there are separated folders for models, controllers, separated routes, (though no views as it just a backend app for now).

## This features in this application include.

- **Movie Feature** where we can post movies, rate movies, update movies, drop comments for movies etc.
- **Actor Feature** every movie should have actors right? So we can post actors with images and assign them to movies.
- **Rating Feature** there is a rating system where each movie can be rated.
- **Movie Category** every movie should belong to a category/genre be it action, romance etc.
- **Blog Feature** I guess it is normal for a movie rating app to have blogs, so I added blog to the backend codebase.
- **Blog Comment** we should be able to comment on blog posts.
- **Followings and followers Feature** if people comment on movies, some will be more active and more trusted than others so I felt the need to come up with a follow feature.
- **Following Activities Feature** if you follow people, you should be able to see their activities.

## I am confident building any Node.js application.
